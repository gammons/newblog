## [Ditching scrum for kanban](https://speakerdeck.com/gammons/ditching-scrum-for-kanban)

I gave a presentation and fireside chat at [CTO School NYC](http://www.meetup.com/ctoschool) about evolving our software development process at PipelineDeals. This talk was based upon my [blog post](https://medium.com/cto-school/ditching-scrum-for-kanban-the-best-decision-we-ve-made-as-a-team-cd1167014a6f#.9nu7criuh) about the same subject.

I gave a talk about QA at [CTO School Philadelphia](http://www.meetup.com/CTO-School-Philadelphia/). QA is an interesting subject when it comes to development teams because every team needs it, but they all do it slightly differently. There are, however some general principles that make up having effective QA in an organization.
